/*

Here i want to create something similar to the custom_log.js script i have for obsidian, but for sfml

i want a second window to pop up to display logging, to replace the terminal and cout << ( which is hard to switch to when using sfml)
this will be a 2nd-ary window with logging displays and a separate module


Create a secondary window and use it as a terminal (SFML)

I avoid using the name space STD instead create a second window and use it as terminal so walking all of the value there so you don’t have to use the actual terminal app. Try that yes always create two windows one the actual project you’re working on to logging 


This will teach you how to use text sprites—as well as separate files and .h heades and so on—and try to make it actually look good. Like get an actual font make it look good.
